# Success Plan

## Plan for the course
<!-- TODO:
to help demonstrate that you understand how you'll be graded in the course,
state what grade you plan to earn and how you will do that, including what you
will do if not everything goes perfectly. For example:
I plan to earn a C by participating actively in class and using office hours for oral exams to earn level 1.  If I struggle with a concept or miss classes, I will
submit pseudocode and explanations to the corresponding assignments to earn
those level 1 achievements.-->


## Office Hours

<!-- TODO: find the office hours and make links to it by putting them in the () -->

- [course website (times only)]()
- [course GitHub org (zoom links)]()


## Communications 

<!-- TODO: fill in when to use each of these after the :-->

I understand the right time to use each mode of communication

- prismia : 
- issue on the class website: 
- issue on an assignment repo: 
- discussion on the class discussion repo: 
- email: 


## Assignment Policies

<!-- TODO: Delete the false statements in each subsection below -->

### Deadlines

- extensions are automatically granted on assignments if submitted 24hours in advance
- late assignments are not graded
- extensions are only for portfolio submissions
- extension requests should be emailed
- extension requests should be issues on your portfolio repository 
- extension requests are granted only for specific reasons
- reasons are only required in extension requests if it is an emergency and late

### Style

- Code can be submitted in any file format as long as it runs
- the style guide is suggestions
- there should always be more code cells than markdown cells
- all code must be motivated
- all results must be interpretted
- using `print` is the best way to show results


### Academic Honesty

- it is okay to submit chatGPT code if the interpretation is my own
- it is never okay to submit chatGPT code
- the penalty for cheating is no credit on that assignment
- the penalty for cheating is ineligible achievments, level depends on assignment or portfolio
