# Getting Started


Portfolio template for CSC and DSP 310

_this is designed to be used by accepting an assignment on github classroom (the url is like: `https://github.com/rhodyprog4ds/portfolio-username`), if you are viewing the source repository (the  url is `https://github.com/rhodyprog4ds/portfolio`), you should go to your repository instead or fork it if you are not enrolled_

**If you are enrolled in the class, using the template from the source repository, not a github classroom link will not create an assignment that can be graded.  **


## Make it yours

**do this for assignment 1** 

- edit `_config.yml` to set your name as author
- fill in the template in  `about.md` to be about yourself
- complete the `success.md` file
- change the logo if you wish (either replace `logo.png` file or upload a different file and replce `logo.png` in `config.yml` with that name)

##  Publishing

This repo is set up to function as a [jupyterbook](https://jupyterbook.org/), the same tool I use to publish the course website.  It can convert markdown and notebook files in to HTML. 


#### On GitHub.com


_At the end of the semester, we will go over what you can do to publish your site_


#### You can build locally 
*optional*

You can run Jupyter book offline to view the compiled version of your portfolio, but you do not need to. There are some parts of this that are experimental and may be hard to get working.

  - follow the [Jupyter Book Setup Instructions](https://jupyterbook.org/start/overview.html) in order to build offline (and view in your loacl browser)
  - follow the [Jupyter Book PDF Instructions](https://jupyterbook.org/advanced/pdf.html) in order to build to pdf offline




## Using your Jupyter Book Portfolio

You can use it by adding files, either markdown files or jupyter notebooks to the folder and pushing to the repository.

Optionally, there's a lot of other features. For information on how to use special formatting, see the [Jupyter Book Documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) and the example files in the `template_files/` folder of this repository.
