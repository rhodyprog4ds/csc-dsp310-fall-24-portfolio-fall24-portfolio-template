# About Me
<!-- TIP:
markdown is related to HTML, designed to be more human friendly; but you
can also use html in markdown files, and markdown comments are HTML comments
There are comments throught out this file (and will be in other assignments to)
that are for you while you're working, but don't need to be visible in the final
document.  Be sure to put your work, that you want graded *not* in a comment
