# About Me
<!-- TIP:
markdown is related to HTML, designed to be more human friendly; but you
can also use html in markdown files, and markdown comments are HTML comments
There are comments throught out this file (and will be in other assignments to)
that are for you while you're working, but don't need to be visible in the final
document.  Be sure to put your work, that you want graded *not* in a comment
-->

<!-- TODO:
include a 3 sentence summary of the most important points you want me to
remember from the following
-->

## Bio
<!-- TODO:
include here anything you want me to know about you and anything that
may help me understand your work in the course, for example:
your name,
 your pronouns,
favorite hobbies,
career aspirations,
why you're taking this class-->



## Data Science, to me

<!-- TODO:
define data science in a few sentences using your own words. remember the
goal here is to demonstrate that you understand what the data science process is-->


## Plan for the course
<!-- TODO:
to help demonstrate that you understand how you'll be graded in the course,
state what grade you plan to earn and how you will do that, including what you
will do if not everything goes perfectly. For example:
I plan to earn a C by participating actively in class and practicing after class
while reading the notes.  If I struggle with a concept or miss classes, I will
submit pseudocode and explanations to the corresponding assignments to earn
those level 1 achievements.-->
